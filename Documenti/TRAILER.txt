RIASSUNTO DELLA STORIA 
(video fighi rubati)
hell. a place made of chaos and flames where no mortal can live without becoming insane. here is where we, the pride and mighty demons, live. our society has always been pretty simple: if i'm stronger than you, you do what i say, so the strongest being is the ruler of hell.
many years ago, Marras, the demon lord, decided to rage war against the mortals to rule them all, but their divinities defeated his army and confined Marras in hell with a powerful spell. 

(stacco, si vede il demone che spiega)
Thousands of years passed, mortals have lost the memory of demons, but demons haven't lost their thirst for blood. Some of us, simple imps, the lowest-class demons, have lost their patience to wait for the spell to end, and so we decided to raise a rebellion to dethrone Marras and guide our people to invade the mortals once again.

(stacco di un qualche tipo con musica)

(dire al giocatore cosa deve fare, gameplay)
your goal is to dethrone Marras, the demon lord. but it won't be easy. Marras has many generals that can't wait to serve their lord and to be promoted, so they will do anything to stop the rebels.
this will of rebellion has become so strong that it has been materialized in a very special artifact: the helm of will. whoever wears this helm, inheritates the experiences and the desires of its predecessor, so who wears the helm it's recognized as the leader of the rebellion horde.
be always a wise and brave leader, recruit more and more imps, learn new strategic techniques and guide the horde to the victory.
